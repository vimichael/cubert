## The Pitch

Learning how to solve a Rubik's cube can be challenging. It's hard to stay motivated from tutorials alone. Cubert is a social platform that enables users to track their progress through a mastery system. If a user gets an impressive time learning an algorithm, they can post about it like a traditional social media.
